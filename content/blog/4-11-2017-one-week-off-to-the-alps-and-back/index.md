# To the Alps

## TLDR
> Riding off that mountain, free as a bird.

My love, my life, the trees, the mountains, the snow..the view!

## Why the Alps?
Because nature is and *always will be* in charge. People did settle, but always hand in hand with nature. People that came to shape nature to their hands never stayed, as they don't have a place in the Alps, just because you can't shape it (completely).. The environment makes me calm, humble, and happy.

## And so we went..to Tignes
The earth is warming up.. The Alps feel it..for the first time ever (since‚ùì), Les Deux Alpes is not able to open their gletcher for the public during the Automn holidays at the end of October.. My wife and I really enjoy that period, as when the sun is out, at 1800 meter the grass is still green, the sun burns and it's great to hike into the mountains. Just walking for hours, without any humans at all. And by taking a lift, 15 minutes later you are at 3000 meter, on the gletcher, with all his snow and ice that is there to stay (for now). Nice conditions to snowboard, certainly because there is a great and huge snowpark during this period of the year for practicing loads of tricks.. And therefore, Les Deux Alpes attracks loads of snowboarders who can't wait until winter times to do what they love to do the most.. BUT.. This year is different. August, summer snowboarding, didn't went as smooth as other years.. The 20 a 25 degrees at the end of July, and the burning sun made the gletcher melt even more then the last several years.. And between August and the end of October, the gletcher only had one tiny snowfall... Not enough to feed the gletcher to welcome all those thousands of snowboarders this Automn. The result, they didn't open up.. The lifts were working though (for free even), to walk and to do downhill mountainbiking for example.. But for us it was a nice opportunity to go somewhere else, for once. We went to the only open ski area in France, Tignes.

## What we did
We rented a very clean apartment via Airbnb, on 2000 metres of altitude. Only 5 minutes away from the 'funiculaire', which takes you with an astonishing speed and underground towards 3000 metres. The only pity is that our daughter couldn't join the ride..as appartently that's dangerous for babies, as they cannot yet adjust the pressure in their head fast enough.. That's at least what they told us.. So of our 6 days stay, I went up 2 days to snowboard.
Basically our trip could be summarised as follows: we were hiking, running, relaxing, and snowboarding. And taking care of a 4 month old crying baby...ü§∑‚Äç She had a difficult week..that happens sometimes.. But most of the time, it's a wonderful child. At least according to the perception of her parents.üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß
